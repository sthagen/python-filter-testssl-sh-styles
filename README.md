# python-filter-testssl-sh-styles
Minimally invasive filter to make the testssl.sh html output more accessible

## Caveat Emptor
:construction: This filter works when using the [testssl.sh v3 branch](https://github.com/sthagen/testssl.sh/tree/3.0) for invocation with the `--html*` options and now just **good 'nuff**&nbsp;:tm:. 

Note: The default branch (with special meaning to github and gitlab users) has the name `default` :wink:
